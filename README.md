# my_DRL_sim
Deep reinforcement learning for locomotion of legged robot.  
This project is created on the basis of a [google_research](https://github.com/google-research) repository named [motion_imitation](https://github.com/google-research/motion_imitation).
The main framework of the project is kept while some module has been changed to suit my situation.
